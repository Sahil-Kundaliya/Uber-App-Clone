# uber_app_Clone

A Flutter project inspired by the Uber app, featuring a modern UI design and a clean, scalable code
structure.

## Features

- Built using **BLoC** for state management, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and
  testability.
- Implements the **MVP architecture** for modular and maintainable code.
- Includes **common widgets** for reusability across the app, speeding up development and ensuring
  consistency.
- Designed to support **smooth animations** (animations to be added in future updates).
